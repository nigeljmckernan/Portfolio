# Introduction

Hi there!

My name is Nigel McKernan and I am an aspiring Data Scientist from Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Here you can find my portfolio of projects that I've undertaken on my personal time.

If you would like to see my personal website which includes my CV and Master's Thesis and its corresponding code, please go [here](https://nigelmckernan.ca).

I prefer to work in R, though I am learning Python from  a data science perspective.

Here are my current projects with links to their respective code and documentation in this repository.

# R

## Master's Thesis

My Master's Thesis examined the **endogenous** link between house prices and air pollution, and to resolve said endogeneity via meteorological data via 2SLS Panel-Data regression model.

You can find an HTML-rendered RMarkdown document [here](https://nigelmckernan.ca/media/ma_paper). I will be uploading the R code to this repository at a later date.
